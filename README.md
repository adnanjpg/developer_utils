# Developer Utils

Developer Utils is a cross-platform versatile, locally run tool designed to streamline everyday development tasks. It's a collection of essential utilities aimed at enhancing developer productivity, offering a range of features commonly required during coding sessions.

This project uses flutter and can run on MacOS, Windows, Linux and the Web. Although you can also run it on Android and iOS, it's not really designed for mobile devices.

I'll be periodically adding new features as I come across them, so feel free to suggest any ideas you may have!

## Features

### 1. String Case Converter
Easily convert strings between various formats:
- Uppercase
- Lowercase
- camelCase
- snake_case

### 2. Unix Time Converter
Effortlessly handle Unix timestamps, supporting conversions between:
- Seconds from epoch
- Milliseconds from epoch
- Microseconds from epoch
- ISO8601 string formats (local and UTC)
- Relative time strings
