# Developer Utils

Developer Utils is a cross-platform versatile, locally run tool designed to streamline everyday development tasks. It's a collection of essential utilities aimed at enhancing developer productivity, offering a range of features commonly required during coding sessions.

This project uses flutter and can run on MacOS, Windows, Linux and the Web. Although you can also run it on Android and iOS, it's not really designed for mobile devices.

I'll be periodically adding new features as I come across them, so feel free to suggest any ideas you may have!
